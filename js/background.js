/**
* Chrome extensions have background page available to them for use
* Basically, browser creates a html document with window and document objects, loads html, css and javascript but doesn't display that document
* The purpose of the background page is to exist in memory in the background
* It is important to know that background page state is shared between extention popup window and any tab(s) opened in the browser
*
* To learn more about background pages read https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/background_pages
*
* Popup page can communicate with background page in two ways
* 1. chrome.extension.getBackgroundPage()
* 2. extension.runtime
*
* chrome.extension.getBackgroundPage() function returns window object of the background page. Any and all global variables set on window object of the background page
* are available for use in popup page
*
* extension.runtime offers infrastructure for client-server message passing communication between popup page and background page via concept of ports
* port is a two-way communication channel between holders of the handle to the port object
*
* To use this infrastructure do the following:
* 1. in the background page attach a listener to the chrome.extension.onConnect event. This event will be triggered each time a connection is requested with the extension
* 2. in the popup page call chrome.extension.connect() function. This function will return the handle to the port object. Also, the same handle will be passed to the onConnect event handler in 1.
* 3. now background page and popup page have a handle to the same port and can pass messages to each other
*
* To learn more about chrome.runtime read https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/runtime
*
* Port has onMessage event. This event is triggered each time a message is sent via port
* Port has postMessage function. This function is used to send a message via port
*
* To learn more about ports read https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/runtime#type-Port
*
* To communicate with the background page from a page displayed in a tab specify content_scripts property in the extension manifest.
* Content script is a js file which is loaded on a page which is opened in a tab.
* Now, please switch to content.js file and read comments there.
*
* To learn more about the manifest read https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest
* To learn more about the content scripts read https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts
